## What does it do?
USC Geoguessr is a web game based on the popular game Geoguessr, where players are dropped into a random location and must use their environment to deduce where it is on a map. USC Geoguessr shows images from around the USC Campus and USC Village then allows players to guess where the photo was taken. USC Students and alumni can test their knowledge of the campus in this interactive experience.
